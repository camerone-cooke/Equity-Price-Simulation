# GBM Portfolio Simulator

Monte Carlo portfolio simulator using Geometric Brownian Motion with correlated asset shocks and live market data.

---

## Project Synopsis

This program simulates potential future values of an equity portfolio using Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo simulation. Live market data is pulled from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library and used to compute expected returns, historical volatility, and correlations between asset pairs. The simulation generates 10,000 price paths for the portfolio and outputs a graphical display of the data along with relevant metrics including VaR, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and probability of loss.
